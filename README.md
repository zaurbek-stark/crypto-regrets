# Crypto Regrets

> This app was built as part of a challenge in the **Codebender AI Bootcamp**. Learn how to build projects like these [here](https://lastcodebender.com/bootcamp).

This app tells you how much money you would have made if you invested in crypto before the last bull run.

This app is built with Next.js. It uses the NVIDIA Nim API with `mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1` to tell jokes and the CoinGecko API for the crypto prices.
